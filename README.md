1. Download this repository contents and open in IntelliJ Idea(preferred).
2. Open main.java and set the ranking type as "Boolean" or "tfidf-Both" or "tf" or "RelevanceFeedback" or "Ananya".
3. Execute the main function and see the results in log.txt file on your project repository.
4. Compare the metrics from the Trec_Eval file using the command 
    ./trec_eval <path to the relevance file> <path to your log file>
5. Index.java contains the code for indexing
6. search.java contains the code for searching and ranking
